    <h1>INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON</h1>
    <p>Python is a dynamic, interpreted (bytecode-compiled) language. There are no type declarations of variables, parameters, functions, or methods in source code. This makes the code short and flexible, and you lose the compile-time type checking of the source code.14-Jun-2022

    <h1>HISTORY OF PYTHON</h1>
    <p>Python was created by Guido van Rossum, and first released on February 20, 1991. While you may know the python as a large snake, the name of the Python programming language comes from an old BBC television comedy sketch series called Monty Python's Flying Circus.
